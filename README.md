# Coffine Business Idea and Process
This is a final project of the Integrative Survival Experience 1 course that we worked on in a group team called 'FanBots Group'. This project basically a business idea and includes all the processes needed to start a new business (business logo, slogan, vision and mission, SWOT analysis, value proposition, financial projection, business model canvas, posters, social media promotion, business 7Ps, division structure, business process flow, business agreement, windows navigation diagram, and UI prototype) but currently, this project has not yet been executed in a real-life.
Our business idea is called 'Coffine'. Coffine is a drop-ship platform that is created by FanBots in an attempt to provide Indonesian coffee producers with a platform for them to distribute their coffee beans around Indonesia.

For more detail about our business idea, you may download and read our presentation slides that I have already attached.
